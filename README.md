```

 - telluride.exe (Windows)
 - telluride_linux (Linux) 
 - telluride_macos.x86_64 (macOS x86_64)
 - telluride_macos.arm64 (macOS apple chips)


## Requirements
 Aside from `bash`,`python3` and `ffmpeg`, the rest should be installed by the `configure.sh` script.
    
 - `bash`
 - `python3`, `pip`, `pylint`
 - `ffmpeg` (for audio-only downloads. audio is extracted from the downloaded video)
 - `yt_dlp`, `pycryptodome`, `pyinstaller`
